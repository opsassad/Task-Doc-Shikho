### üìå Validation Pattern

Both sides (Agent claim & Daily Sales record) format sales as:

```
Sale‚ÄØDate-Mobile‚ÄØNumber-Agent‚ÄØName-Channel
```

Example:  `45809-1731126781-Md. Nafis Siddque-cx-inbound`

* **Match = Valid:** All four elements match between claim and sales data.
* **Mismatch = Invalid:** Any element differs ‚Üí claim becomes **Invalid**.

### üö® Invalid Sale Workflow

1. **Auto‚ÄëEmail Alert**

   * When a sale is flagged Invalid, an email is sent to **Agent, TL, and Manager**.
   * Subject indicates the issue; body states the claim must be investigated.

2. **Investigation Window**

   * **Deadline:** TL must post findings in the **‚ÄúInvalid Input‚Äù** group **by end of next working day** (Email‚ÄØDate‚ÄØ+‚ÄØ1 working day).

3. **Classify the Issue** (TL responsibility)

   | Type               | Identification Rule                        |
   | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
   | **Late Claim**     | `Claim‚ÄØDate > Submission‚ÄØDate`             |
   | **Wrong Number**   | Submitted phone ‚â† actual customer phone    |
   | **Wrong Agent**    | Submitted agent name ‚â† correct agent       |
   | **Delete Request** | Claim confirmed false; TL requests removal |
