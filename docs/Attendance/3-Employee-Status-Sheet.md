## üìò Employee Status Sheet

### üìã Overview

- **üìå Purpose:** The Employee Status sheet maintains centralized HR records and ensures synchronization between HR and CRM employee data.
- **üóÇÔ∏è Data Source:** Primary data source: [HR] Master Database for Tele-sales. This database is updated by HR whenever an employee joins or resigns.
- **üîÅ Data Integration:** The sheet integrates with CRM Employee Records by matching on the Agent Name. Agent names must be unique. If a new joiner's name conflicts with an existing name, add a nickname or surname to distinguish.
