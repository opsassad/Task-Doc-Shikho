## 📘 Employee Status Sheet

### 📋 Overview

- **📌 Purpose:** The Employee Status sheet maintains centralized HR records and ensures synchronization between HR and CRM employee data.
- **🗂️ Data Source:** Primary data source: [HR] Master Database for Tele-sales. This database is updated by HR whenever an employee joins or resigns.
- **🔁 Data Integration:** The sheet integrates with CRM Employee Records by matching on the Agent Name. Agent names must be unique. If a new joiner's name conflicts with an existing name, add a nickname or surname to distinguish.

### 🧩 Role of This Sheet

| Function | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| Joined Employee Tracking | Maintains all currently joined agents synced from HR data |
| Resignation Updates | Reflects when agents have resigned, ensuring accurate headcount and status |
| Status Monitoring | Helps identify active and inactive employees in CRM systems |

### 🧰 Basic Troubleshooting

| Issue | Possible Cause | Resolution |
|:------|:---------------|:-----------|
| Sheet appears broken or blank | Formula other than IMPORTRANGE might be broken | Check formulas for errors or missing references |
| Data not updating from HR sheet | Issue with IMPORTRANGE permission or link | Ensure the import range link has access and correct sheet reference |
| Duplicate or mismatched names | Agent name is not unique or inconsistently spelled | Coordinate with HR to apply a nickname or add a surname to avoid conflict |
| Unexpected values in CRM sync | Name mismatch between Employee Status and CRM Employee Records | Validate name consistency across both sheets |

> **⚠️ Note:** This sheet is generally stable. If anything breaks beyond formulas, reach out to the HR team for clarification.

## 📘 Case Records

### 📋 Overview

- **📌 Purpose:** The Case Records sheet is responsible for tracking employee resignations, holidays, and leave details. It plays a critical role in automating and updating the monthly attendance sheet named BI-Data Sorted by supplying relevant status symbols (e.g., R, H, OTD).
- **🔄 Data Circulation:** This sheet aggregates and relays leave and resignation-related records from multiple sources into structured tables. It feeds attendance-impacting data directly into the monthly attendance pipeline.

### 📊 Key Tables & Their Roles

#### 🟥 1. Resign Records

| Field | Source / Logic |
|:------|:---------------|
| CRM Agent Name | From Employee Status — Must match CRM Employee Records |
| ID | HR-issued employee ID |
| HR Name | Name from HR's employee database |
| Effective Resignation | =Last Working Day + 1 |
| Status | Always R (Symbol for "Resigned" in attendance system) |

- **Purpose:** Identifies resigned employees. Used in attendance to reflect resignation.
- **Filter Condition:** Any row from Employee Status with non-empty "Effective Resignation Date".
- **Note:** Only CRM agents tracked from Nov 2022 onwards are covered.

#### 🟨 2. Leave Records

- **Applies to:** All telesales agents

#### 🟦 4. OTD Records (Over Time Duty)

| Field | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| OTD Dates | Gov't Holidays when Shikho decides to operate telesales |
| OTD Status | Always OTD (Special symbol in attendance sheet) |

- **Update Type:** Manually updated by HR team
- **Applies to:** All telesales agents
- **Note:** Indicates agents worked on official holidays with allowance entitlements

#### 🟫 5. General Leave/Holidays – Agent Specific

| Field | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| Agent Name | Must match CRM Employee Records |
| Start Date | Start date of the condition |
| End Date | End date of the condition |
| Leave Status | Custom attendance symbol (e.g., A, R, H, OTD, etc) |

- **Update Type:** Manually updated by HR team
- **Purpose:** Overrides all other attendance conditions — acts as a master control
- **Use Case:** Used to change agent status manually (e.g., override Present to Absent)

### 🧰 Basic Troubleshooting

| Issue | Possible Cause | Action |
|:------|:---------------|:-------|
| Sheet data not updating in BI-Data Sorted | Break in linked formula or outdated import | Check import formulas and ensure BI sheet access is maintained |
| Resigned employee not marked as 'R' | Effective resignation date not set or CRM name mismatch | Validate Employee Status data and CRM name formatting |
| Leave records not reflecting | Leave not approved or mismatch in name | Confirm leave status in HR form and cross-check against CRM records |
| Holidays/OTD not applied in attendance | HR hasn't updated holiday/OTD table | Follow up with HR team for manual updates |
| Agent-specific override not working | Date range mismatch or wrong symbol | Check for overlapping ranges and verify the override symbol used |

> **⚠️ Note:** Most issues originate from data entry or HR team dependencies. The structure itself is stable.

## 📘 Raw Dump Sheet

### 📋 Overview

- **📌 Purpose:** The Raw Dump sheet aggregates all Month-over-Month (MoM) attendance data into a flattened format using the FLATTEN() formula. This transformation enables dynamic, flexible reporting and cross-period analysis.

### 🔄 Functionality Overview

| Component | Details |
|:----------|:--------|
| Source | Pulls data from each monthly attendance sheet (e.g., January-25, February-25, March-25 sheets) |
| Flattening | Converts matrix-style monthly data into a long, table-like format |

### 📊 Usage

- **QA Team:** Uses it as the primary source for preparing KPI reports
- **Finance Team:** Uses it to calculate monthly/quarterly incentives
- **HR Team:** Uses it to calculate monthly salary/leave and others

### ⚠️ Performance & Stability Notes

| Consideration | Details |
|:--------------|:--------|
| Sheet Stability | Generally stable; formula-driven |
| Max Safe Data Limit | Keep under 40,000 rows [approx] to prevent performance issues with QUERY or IMPORTRANGE |
| Risk of Failure | High volume may cause linked sheets (like KPI, Incentive) to break or become unresponsive |
| Prevention Tip | Regularly archive old months [keep last 4 months] or use optimized QUERY filters/AppScript to limit data scope |

> **📌 Reminder:** If this sheet slows down or linked reports stop updating, check data volume first before debugging formulas.

## 📘 Working Employee Sheet

### 📋 Overview

- **📌 Purpose:** The Working Employee sheet dynamically generates a list of active employees for any specified date range, enabling date-specific attendance and resource tracking.

### 🔄 Data Source

- **Primary Source:** Pulls from the Employee Status sheet
- **Filter Logic:** Uses QUERY formula to identify employees who have not resigned as of the specified date and whose joining date is before or on the selected date

### ⚙️ How It Works

| Component | Details |
|:----------|:--------|
| Filter Formula | Typically uses `QUERY(Employee Status!A:Z, "SELECT ... WHERE ...")` |
| User Input | Sheet allows selecting Start Date and End Date for dynamic filtering |
| Auto-Refresh | Employee list updates automatically based on the input date range |

### 📊 Use Cases

- Prepare attendance summary for a specific range
- Extract list of currently working agents for reports, payroll, or QA/KPI use
- Help identify active CRM users vs. resigned/terminated ones

### 🧰 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Likely Cause | Solution |
|:------|:-------------|:---------|
| Missing employees in filtered output | Wrong date range or mismatch in employee joining/resign | Verify joining and resignation dates in Employee Status sheet |
| Employees showing despite resignation | Query not excluding resigned employees properly | Adjust query to check for null in resignation/effective resignation |
| Query returns blank or error | Range reference or formula syntax issue | Validate column references and ensure Employee Status data is complete |

> **⚠️ Note:** The accuracy of this sheet depends entirely on up-to-date Employee Status entries.

## 🔒 CRM ID Status - Task Breakdown

### 🎯 Purpose

To identify resigned employees, pull their leads from the CRM, deactivate their CRM IDs, and log the activity in a side table.

### 🛠️ Steps

#### ✅ Check for Resigned Employees

- Go to the Employee Status or Case Records sheet.
- Filter rows where Effective Resignation Date is not blank and is on or before today.
- Cross-check with the CRM Employee Records for name and ID consistency.

#### 📤 Pull Their Leads from CRM

- Log in to the CRM tool.
- Search by Employee ID or Name.
- Export or record active leads still assigned to them.
- Transfer/reassign leads as per team protocol (if needed).

#### 🚫 Deactivate CRM ID

Either:
- Disable the user from the CRM admin panel,
- Or inform the tech/admin team with the deactivation list.
- Confirm that login access and lead routing is stopped.

#### 📝 Update Side Table in CRM ID Status Sheet

Add the following details:

| Employee ID | Name | Lead Pull Status | Deactivated On |
|:------------|:-----|:-----------------|:---------------|
| EMP1234 | John Doe | ✅ Pulled / ❌ No Leads | 28-Jun-2025 |

### ⏱️ When to Perform

- **Weekly:** Every Saturday morning.
- **Monthly Sweep:** On 1st of every month as a catch-all.

### ⚠️ Important Checks

- Ensure no duplicate resignations are being handled twice.
- Keep lead pull/export traceable (CRM screenshots or export logs).
- Don't deactivate CRM access before lead transfer is confirmed.
- If CRM name doesn't match exact HR name, use ID for mapping.

## 🧮 BI-Data Sorted - Task Details

### 🎯 Purpose

To produce the final daily attendance status for each telesales agent by merging:

- BI-sourced daily attendance (BI Dump Source)
- Leave records
- Resignation data

This sheet is already automated using formulas and logic mapping.

### ⚙️ Current Automation

- Attendance status is calculated automatically using formulas.
- Leave (L), Resigned (R), Holiday (H), OTD, and other status symbols are derived from:
  - Case Records (Leave & Resignation)
  - BI Dump Source (Daily presence)
  - Employee Status (Active/Resigned validation)

### 🛠️ Manual Maintenance Step

#### 📌 ONLY THING YOU NEED TO DO:

➡ Copy the last row of formulas and paste them downward if:

- New agents are added,
- Or the bottom formulas don't auto-extend due to manual edits or formula breakage.

#### How:

- Scroll to the bottom-most row where formulas are active.
- Select that row (or range of rows).
- Drag down using the fill handle or paste it down manually (for ~50 extra rows as buffer).
- Stop at a reasonable limit — don't blindly extend down 10,000 rows.

### 🧰 Troubleshooting / Notes

| Issue | Cause | Action |
|:------|:------|:-------|
| Some agents show blank | Formulas didn't extend | Paste formulas further down |
| Attendance looks wrong | Overwrite by manual entry or status mismatch | Check formula integrity and status overrides |
| Slowness in sheet | Too many formula rows | Limit range, or archive old months |
