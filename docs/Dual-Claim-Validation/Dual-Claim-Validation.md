## üìä **Dual Claim Validation - SOP**

### üîé **Identify Dual Claims**

A sale is marked as **dual claimed** if:

* Multiple agents have claimed the **same sale on the same day**, even after data correction.

---

### üöÄ **Trigger: Sale Marked Invalid due to Dual Claim**

1. Agent, TL, and Manager receive an **email notification** with a link to a **document submission form**.

2. The form:

   * Is **secured, conditional**, and has an **expiry window (72 hours)** (excluding holidays).
   * Has **prefilled and locked fields** (read-only).
   * URL parameters are **Base64 encoded** to prevent tampering.
   * After expiry, **URL becomes inaccessible**.

3. A **reminder email** is triggered in the **early morning of the deadline day**.

### ‚úçÔ∏è **After Submission**

* QA team validates the submitted documentation using standard audit parameters.
* Final outcome is emailed to Agent, TL, and Manager:

  * Declares **who rightfully owns the sale**.

  * Agent Name
  * Sales Channel (if necessary)
  * CRM Event based on Event ID
